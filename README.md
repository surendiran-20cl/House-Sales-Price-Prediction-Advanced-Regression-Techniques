## Project Overview
Predicting house prices is a classic regression problem and is commonly used to demonstrate machine learning workflows. This project builds and evaluates several models, including linear models and tree-based ensemble methods, to predict the final sale price of houses based on a wide range of features.

The goal is to build an accurate and robust model that generalizes well to unseen data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It includes:
- `train.csv`: 1460 observations with 81 features (including the target variable `SalePrice`).
- `test.csv`: 1459 observations with 80 features.

The features represent various aspects of residential homes such as lot size, year built, quality, condition, location, and more.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/surendiran-20cl/House-Sales-Price-Prediction-Advanced-Regression-Techniques.git
cd House-Sales-Price-Prediction-Advanced-Regression-Techniques
```

2. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Main libraries used:**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or above installed.

## Usage
You can open the notebook file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Run the cells sequentially to:
- Explore the data
- Preprocess and clean the dataset
- Engineer new features
- Train and evaluate different machine learning models
- Generate predictions on the test data
- Prepare the submission file for Kaggle

You can modify the notebook to experiment with different models or hyperparameters.

## Approach
The major steps followed in this project are:

- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Imputed missing values using appropriate techniques for each feature type.
  - Handled outliers and removed extreme values when necessary.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Analyzed distributions, relationships between features, and target variable behavior.
  - Visualized feature importance and correlations.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new features from existing ones.
  - Transformed skewed features using log transformation.
  - Applied encoding methods for categorical variables.

- **Model Building**:
  - Implemented baseline models like Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso Regression.
  - Used advanced models like XGBoost and LightGBM.
  - Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and cross-validation.
  - Developed ensemble models through stacking to improve performance.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the primary evaluation metric.
  - Validated models through cross-validation.

## Results
- The best-performing model was a stacked ensemble that combined several strong base models.
- Achieved a competitive RMSE on the Kaggle leaderboard.
- Feature engineering and careful regularization significantly boosted model performance.

## Future Work
Some areas for potential future improvements include:
- Incorporating external data sources to enhance feature richness.
- Further optimization of ensemble methods like blending or stacking.
- Exploring deep learning approaches for regression.
