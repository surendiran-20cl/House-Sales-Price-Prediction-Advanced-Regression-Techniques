# House Sales Prices Prediction - Kaggle Competition

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the final sale prices of houses based on a wide variety of features using advanced regression techniques.  
It is based on Kaggle’s popular "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition.  
The goal of the project is to build accurate and generalizable machine learning models that can predict house prices for unseen data.

This repository presents the full data science workflow:  
from data exploration and preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and submission preparation.


## Problem Statement

The task is to predict the sales price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.  
The dataset includes features describing every aspect of residential homes, such as size, location, condition, and year built.

A successful model should not only fit the training data but should also generalize well to the test data provided.



## Dataset

The dataset consists of two CSV files:

- **train.csv**: 1460 observations with 81 features, including the target variable `SalePrice`.
- **test.csv**: 1459 observations with 80 features (without `SalePrice`).

Each feature provides specific information about a house such as:
- Lot size
- Overall material quality
- Year of construction
- Neighborhood
- Number of rooms
- Presence of garages, pools, basements, etc.

The target variable (`SalePrice`) is continuous, making this a regression problem.

You can find the dataset [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).



## Project Approach

The project follows a structured, step-by-step methodology:

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Loaded and examined the data to understand the nature of each feature.
- Identified and handled missing values appropriately:
  - Numerical features were imputed using median or mean values.
  - Categorical features were imputed using the mode or a separate "None" category when applicable.
- Removed or capped outliers to prevent them from skewing model training.
- Checked distributions and relationships between variables.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created new features by combining or transforming existing ones.
- Transformed skewed numerical features using log transformations.
- Applied Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.
- Standardized or normalized numerical variables to ensure model stability.

### 3. Model Building and Evaluation
- Built multiple models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - XGBoost Regressor
  - LightGBM Regressor
- Used GridSearchCV and cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluated models primarily using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Compared performance across models and selected the best ones.

### 4. Model Stacking and Ensemble
- Combined predictions from different strong models to build an ensemble.
- Leveraged stacking/blending techniques to improve predictive performance.
- Generated the final predictions for the test dataset.



## Results

- Models like XGBoost performed significantly better than basic linear models.
- Feature engineering, especially handling skewness and missing values carefully, had a strong positive impact on performance.
- Final RMSE on validation sets was competitive with top Kaggle submissions.
